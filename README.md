# gpio-op
**Simple GPIO library for OrangePi.** *gpio-op*ã€€is designed for handling OrangePi's GPIO pins from C++. This library directly controls these pins via configulation registers. To use registers (in other words, using `/dev/mem`), *gpio-op* requires root permission.

# Supported devices
Currently you can use with these devices. Others, such as OrangePi One, also can run by *gpio-op* with some changes probably.
- OrangePi Zero
